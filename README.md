#Practice with Unheap Plugins

Create an Apple-like one page scroll website (iPhone 5S website) with One Page Scroll plugin

#Requirement

jQuery (1.9.0 or later)

note: jQuery 1.9.0 or later is strongly recommended because using jQuery less than 1.8.3 and jquery.onepage-scroll.js together turns out to be a hash-based XSS vulnerabiliry.

#Compatibility

Modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both desktop and smartphones have been tested. Should work fine on IE8 and IE9 as well.
